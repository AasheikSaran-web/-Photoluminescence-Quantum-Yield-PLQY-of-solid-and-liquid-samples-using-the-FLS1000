## Abstract

Photoluminescence is the emission of light from a material after absorbing photons. PLQY, defined as the ratio of emitted to absorbed photons, is crucial for assessing material efficiency in applications like OLEDs, quantum dot displays, and fluorescence microscopy.

## Objectives

- Measure PLQY for solid and liquid luminescent materials
- Study the efficiency and emission properties of MEH-PPV
- Understand the advantages of using an integrating sphere

## Methodology

### Instruments Used

- **FLS1000 Photoluminescence Spectrometer**  
  - 405 nm excitation source  
  - High-resolution detection system
